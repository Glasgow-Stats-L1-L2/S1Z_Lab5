## Intended Learning Outcomes:

* Build a logistic regression model for the risk of heart disease.
* Interpret the coefficients of this model
* Calculate the odds and probabilities of heart disease risk from this model


## An Introdution to Logistic Regression Modeling 

This lab will explore the concept of modelling data using logistic regression. Logistic regression is a type of Generalized Linear Model (GLM) which allows us to build models when there is a categorical response variable with two levels, e.g. yes and no.

The key idea behind this is to attempt to explore a relationship between a:

* Binary response variable \(Y_i\), and
* Explanatory/predictor variables \(x_i\).

<br>

To model a binary response, we use the Logit Function which is the log-odds of \(p_i\) (the probability of "success" for outcome \(i\)) to transform our response variable. This gives the formula for a logistic regression model as:

\[\boxed{g(p)=log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})=\beta_0+\beta_1x_{1i}+...+\beta_kx_{ki}}\]

<br>

Once fit well, we can use these models for predictions of the response variable and find the odds of \(p_i\):

\[\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}=exp(\beta_0+\beta_1x_{1i}+...+\beta_kx_{ki})\]


and/or \(p_i\) itself:

\[p_i=\frac{exp(\beta_0+\beta_1x_{1i}+...+\beta_kx_{ki})}{1+exp(\beta_0+\beta_1x_{1i}+...+\beta_kx_{ki})}\]
