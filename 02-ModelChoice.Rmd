# Modelling our Data

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = ""}

```

We would like to fit a model that estimates heart disease risk using multiple explanatory variables. Our response variable is the binary variable TenYearCHD: whether a patient developed coronary heart disease over 10 years, where Yes=0 and No =1.


**What distribution do we expect our response variable to take?**
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcq1 <- c("Normal Distribution", 
answer = "Binomial Distribution", "Exponential Distribution")
```
`r longmcq(mcq1)`

<br>

<br>

As our response is a categorical variable we will need to use a generalized linear mixed model (GLM), specifically one with a logit function as our response is binary (0 or 1) and therefore we can assume binomially distributed.


\[\boxed{g(p)=log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})=\beta_0+\beta_1x_{1i}+...+\beta_kx_{ki}}\]


The code to build and view a model that uses all 6 variables to predict the log odds of ten-year CHD is:

```{r}
logistic_model <- glm(TenYearCHD~male+age+education+cigsPerDay+diabetes+sysBP ,family = "binomial", data = HEARTDISEASE)
summary(logistic_model)
```
<br>

**Looking the p-values for each variable, do you think there are any that are not significant predictors of CHD that could be removed from the model?**
`r fitb("education")`

<br>

**Task 1**

Using the code above try to make the model again but with only the variables that you think are significant:

`r hide("Solution")`
Since the variable `education` does not seem to be a significant predictor of ten-year CHD risk, we could build the model without it.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
logistic_model2 <- glm(TenYearCHD~male+age+cigsPerDay+diabetes+sysBP ,family = "binomial", data = HEARTDISEASE)
summary(logistic_model2)
```
`r unhide()`


Lets use the following model to learn more about CHD risk:

`CHD_model <- glm(TenYearCHD~male+age+cigsPerDay+diabetes+sysBP ,family = "binomial", data = HEARTDISEASE)`

<br>

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
CHD_model <- glm(TenYearCHD~male+age+cigsPerDay+diabetes+sysBP ,family = "binomial", data = HEARTDISEASE)
```

First, let's use the `summary()` function to produce a summary of the model output.
```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
summary(CHD_model)
```

**Task 2**

Based on this output, what is the equation of the logistic regression model? *(Answers to 3 decimal places)*

<!-- <center> \(log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})\) = `r fitb(-7.960)` + `r fitb(0.460)` `male` + `r fitb(0.066)` `age` + `r fitb(0.021)` `cigsPerDay` + `r mcq(c("0.002",answer="0.782", "0.220"))` `diabetes` + `r mcq(c("0.002",answer="0.017", "0.021"))` `sysBP`</center> -->
